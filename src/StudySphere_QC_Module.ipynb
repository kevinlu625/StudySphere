    "- Removing low-quality or downvoted questions\n",
    "- Highlighting the top-rated answers\n",

    "- **Username**: Unique username of the user posting the question.\n",
    "- **Question Type**: Type of question (e.g., Multiple Choice, Short Answer).\n",
    "- **Question**: The text of the question.\n",
    "- **QuestionId**: Unique identifier for the question.\n",
    "- **Answer**: Suggested answer provided by the user.\n",
